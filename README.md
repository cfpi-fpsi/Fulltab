# Overview
This browser extensions allows the user to make a video fill the space
of the entire tab view. Early version with limited functionality.

# Usage
TODO.

# Limitations
The limitation of this extension is that if a website dynamically adds
a new video, the Fulltab icon will not appear over it. This is fixable
probably with some background script.
